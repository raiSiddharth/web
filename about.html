  <h1> Its all about me </h1>
  <p>Heyy hello namaste namashkar Aadaab ...</p>
  <p> Since you are reading it, that means you want to know about me, means you care and if you care then I care,
     So welcome to my website</p>
  <p> Well, I am Siddharth, friends call me Sid, so if we happen to be friends you can call me Sid.I'm from Azamgarh,
    the same city Abu Salem is/was(I'm not sure he is dead or alive) from. I did my schooling at
    Children College(for the record, those are not the best childhood memories). I was one of the bright students but not
    one of the highest scoring one(but sometimes I did).</p>
  <p> I am an aspiring entrepreneur(atleast that's what I like to think of myself), a web developer, programmer, blogger
    and a student. And in case you want to have your own blog or website, I am the guy to ask. Ohh wait a sec.. Did I
    forget to mention that nothing in this world is for free? I am a bibliophile, so if the idea of gifting me books
    crosses your mind, don't think twice, just do it. Love is one among my strong suits so if you offer me some
    you won't be disappointed. Okay, thats it, I'm not telling any more. </p>
